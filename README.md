Alex: *"**Nanuk** makes strong and reliable rugged cases that are great for organizing small electronics and valuables. Fitting a monitor, computer and other parts into these cases for a cyberdeck or retro gaming project is very difficult. Dedicating a case to one specific electronic task is a smarter choice. 3D printing one or more panels to sort the inside of these cases is the best option for organization and longevity. I've used several Nanuk 904 cases because they are the maximum size that can fit on my LulzBot 747 Sidekick 3D printer."*
